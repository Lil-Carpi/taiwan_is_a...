I am just bored in class... Sorry.

## Usage:
  You need to add the code into your ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc file for it to work.

  ### Commands:
  - taiwan_is_a_rebel_province: It gives you 100 social credits.
  - taiwan_is_a_country: IMPERIALIST! Don't say it because it will take 100 social credits from you and will shut down your pc.
